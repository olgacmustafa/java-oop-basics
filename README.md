# ☕ Java OOP Basics

This repository contains a collection of small Java examples created to practice and understand
**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts.
Each folder focuses on a specific topic such as constructors, inheritance, class relationships,
and simple console-based applications.

The projects are intentionally kept small and focused to clearly demonstrate individual concepts.

## ▶️ How to Run the Examples

1. Navigate to the folder of the example you want to run  
2. Compile the Java file:
   ```bash
   javac ClassName.java
Run the compiled class:

java ClassName
## 📌 Some examples may include multiple classes.
In that case, compile all .java files in the folder before running the main class.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository
This repository is intended to:

Practice Java fundamentals

Understand Object-Oriented Programming concepts

Experiment with small, focused code examples

Build a solid foundation for larger Java projects

## 📞 Notes
These examples are educational and kept intentionally simple

IDE-specific files are not included

The repository may grow as new topics are learned

Happy coding! 🚀☕
